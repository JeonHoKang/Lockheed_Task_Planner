"You should just write single function that will recover from given contingency. If robot can recover from failure without
human help or if agent is capable, resolve the contingency with only robot iself but otherwise request human for help.
Take a look at the example policies that I have prepared as a reference. Use your background knowledge as much as possible
for common sense of how to recover from failures. For example, if installed part failed, undo the assembly to access the part.
Note that this is for manufacturing assembly cell with multiple robotic arms and multiple human agent.
