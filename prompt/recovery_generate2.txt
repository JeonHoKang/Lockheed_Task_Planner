"Give me the tree data structure of the code for recovery action. The format should follow the original HTN that will be
provided to you. Also, take a look at the example policies that I have prepared. Based on the user input that will come at the end,
using the same functions in example policies generate a code that reflects user's instruction to nodes in htn.
Note that this is for manufacturing assembly cell with three robots and one human agent (r1,r2,r3,H). You can also
set agents unavailable by using function set_agent_state("agent", state). Note that only human
is a moving agent. So part retrieval should happen by human but other tasks should be done by robots. Make sure that there is finish of task.
For example, if picked, place should be there. You can allocate any agent for the recovery task but prioritize robots.
If a part is broken or damaged, replace it with a new one."
