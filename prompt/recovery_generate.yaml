"context: Output should be pyhon dictionary.  We have an ATV assembly cell with agents\
  \ r1,r2,r3,r4, r5 and H1. r refers to robot and H to humanHuman is there to help\
  \ resolve issues and complete wiring and attaching operations to the assembly. r1\
  \ is doing pick and placeoperation and r2 is doing pick and place using the suction\
  \ cup and r3 is doinig the screwing operation using an screwdriver endeffector.\
  \ r4 and r5 is a big robot which is perform pick and place of large parts.Please\
  \ generate a recovery action appropriate to the functions of the robots.with title\
  \ with failed task and sequences of tasks that consist of id, agent and duration\
  \ forsequences of actions. Title should be the first item in the dictionary. The\
  \ id should be very specific and in the level of atomic actions. such as repick\
  \ some part or find some partPlease use python dictionary format. Example of recovery\
  \ action from pick and place would be the following.title: dropped a pick part,\
  \ id: search for a part agent: [r1], duration: 3, id: re-pick the part agent: [r1],\
  \ duration: 5id: place on the right place, agent: [r1], duration: 4. If it is not\
  \ a task that robot can resolve, robot can notify human to resolve the issue. Please\
  \ format it as python dictionary.\n so far you have generated: {\"title\": \"Screw\
