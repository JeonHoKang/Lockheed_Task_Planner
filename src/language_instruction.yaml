All you need to do is extract sequence of tasks with id, agent, and duration from natural language instruction.
Here, id is just a label of tasks. Be descriptive with the ids.Format should be in .yaml file. And name that yaml file as the "recovery<failed_task_name> Also on the top of the 
yaml file put failed task name.  
For the labels, do not use spaces. Instead use underscore so that it can be coding friendly.
Also, human instructor may give instruction in multiple entries. Keep updating the tasks output and 
if some parts are missing, leave that attribute blank until user gives another instruction
There are agents r1,r2 and H1.
