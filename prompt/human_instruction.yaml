"All you need to do is extract sequence of tasks with id, agent, and duration from natural language instruction.\
Here, id is just a label of tasks. Be descriptive with the ids.Format should be a dictionary in python.\
Also store the failed task name with the dictionary key and value.  \
For the labels, do not use spaces. Instead use underscore so that it can be coding friendly.\
Also, human instructor may give instruction in multiple entries. Keep updating the tasks output and \
if some parts are missing, leave that attribute blank until user gives another instruction\
There are agents r1,r2, r3, r4, r5 and H1.\
Put agent in square bracket.\
We will assume that time unit is in seconds always. So skip unit for time and keep it as integer.\
Also, if human gives another instruction number, create a seperate dictionary. We have a ATV assembly cell with many operations such as\
screwing, pick and place, etc. "
